    <h1>Fill in the Blank with placeholder text</h1>
	<hr>
	<p>Web developers traditionally use lorem ipsum text as a <b>placeholder text</b>. The lorem ipsum text is randomly scraped from a famous passage by Cicero of Ancient Rome.<br>

Lorem ipsum text has been used as placeholder text by typesetters since the 16th century, and this tradition continues on the web.<br>

Well, 5 centuries is long enough. Since we're building whatever we want, let's use something called <b>"Accio ipsum text"</b>.<br>

Replace the text inside your p element with the first few words of this Accio ipsum text:<br>

Accio ipsum dolor sit amet, join course, solve assignments, get placed above 5 lpa and live life king size.</p>
